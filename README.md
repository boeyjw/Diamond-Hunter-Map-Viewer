# Map Viewer

This is the Map Viewer application that allows you to change the coordinates for the [Diamond Hunter] (https://github.com/boeyjw/dh-4-mv) game.

Features:

-Custom axe and boat coordination with placement validation. You can't put any of these on the tree, water, player, diamonds, axe or boat. Placement is done using drag and drop.

-Auto save function. Everytime you drag and drop an axe or boat, the coordinates you successfully placed on is saved automatically.

-Map information. Hover over the map and view information of each tile of the map in the top right box.

-Game integration. The entire [Diamond Hunter] (https://github.com/boeyjw/dh-4-mv) game is integrated into the Map Viewer. You can play the game right after you changed the coordinates. Nevertheless, you can also run the [DiamondHunter.jar] (https://github.com/boeyjw/dh-4-mv/releases) to run custom coordinates. Its your choice.

Head over to the [Releases] (https://github.com/boeyjw/dh-cw2/releases) to download the runnable jar only or just clone the entire repository.
